# Sea-Game
Academic project video game for comp 1020

Created an under the sea themed video game using packages pygame, sys, and random.  In this project, I created classes and definitions to implement this game.

The goal of the game is to stay alive as a long as possible.  There are two types of enemies that will deduct life points and powerups that add life points.  The player is attatched to your mouse and life is deducted when the player hovers or comes into contact with an enemy.  When player comes into contact with powerups, the powerups disappear.
